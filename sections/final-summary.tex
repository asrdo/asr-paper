\section{Similarities and Overlapping Themes Across The Papers}
\subsection{Historical Evolution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Several papers discuss the historical evolution of ASR, starting from early analog devices (e.g., "Radio Rex") to statistical methods like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs).
    \item Common acknowledgment of Mooreâ€™s Law and advances in compute power as a driving force behind modern ASR systems.
\end{itemize}
